      <p>Summary: The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is a species renowned for its extraordinary life cycle and behaviors. These butterflies embark on a long-distance migration from North America to central Mexico, spanning generations. Their life begins as tiny eggs laid on milkweed plants, and the subsequent stages include the distinct caterpillar, chrysalis, and finally, the orange and black-winged adult. Monarchs caterpillars feed exclusively on the milkweed plant, acquiring toxins that make them unappealing to predators and their vibrant coloration serves as a warning signal in the natural world.
